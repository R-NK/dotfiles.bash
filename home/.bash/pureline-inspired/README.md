pureline-inspired
=================

This repository is inspired by [chris-marsh/pureline](https://github.com/chris-marsh/pureline.git).

And the code of this repository is based on [chris-marsh/pureline](https://github.com/chris-marsh/pureline.git).

So I will not write a documentation of `pureline-inspired`. Please understand.

```
$ repo=${Directory you want to install in}
$ git clone https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/pureline-inspired.git ${repo}
